# CardTitle

## Component representing the title of a card

`CardTitle` is used when creating the title of a card, **you don't need to use this component directly**, as a title is passed by props to a `Card`component.

`title` should always be present when using `CardTitle`.

export const Template = (args) => <CardTitle {...args} />;

</Canvas>
